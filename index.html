  <p>Myungsin, Cho (조명신)!</p>
	I am a graduate student in Department of Mathematics at Indiana University Bloomington, working under the guidance of Professor Michael Mandell. <br>

 My research interests revolve around algebraic topology, with a focus on stable homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and trace methods. <br>


Before that, I did MS in Math at Seoul National University under supervision of Professor Otto van Koert. <br>

Before that, I did BS in Engineering at Korea Aerospace University. <br>
